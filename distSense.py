# this is a python program that uses libraries from Dexter Industries
# to interface with 
# 1. Grove Ultrasonic Ranger (plug into any digital port)
# 2. Grove Rotary Angle Sensor (aka potentiometer, plug into any analog port)
# 3. Grove LCD RGB Backlight (can be plugged into any i2c port)

# Your task is to write a program that
# 1. Lets you set a threshold distance by turning the rotary angle sensor
# 2. Measures the distance to an object using the ultrasonic ranger
# 3. Determines whether the object is within the threshold distance
# Your program will also print out to the LCD screen three pieces of information:
# 1. Current threshold value (top line)
# 2. “OBJ PRES” (top line) if the ultrasonic ranger output falls below the threshold value
# 3. Current ultrasonic ranger measurement (bottom line)
